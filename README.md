LUBS1086 Exploring Your Potential
Semester 2, 2024/2025
Assignments should be a maximum of 2000 words in length.All coursework assignments that contribute to the assessment of a module are subject to a word limit, as specified on the assessment brief.    The word limit is an extremely important aspect of good academic practice, and must be adhered to.      Unless stated otherwise in the relevant module handbook (if one has been provided), the word count includes EVERYTHING (i.e. all text in the main body of the assignment including summaries, subtitles, contents pages, tables, supportive material whether in footnotes or in-text references) except the main title, reference list and/or bibliography and any appendices.    It is not acceptable to present matters of substance, which should be included in the main body of the text, in the appendices (“appendix abuse”).    It is not acceptable to attempt to hide words in graphs and diagrams; only text which is strictly necessary should be included in graphs and diagrams.You are required to adhere to the word limit specified and state an accurate word count on the cover page of your assignment brief.    Your declared word count must be accurate, and should not mislead. Making a fraudulent statement concerning the work submitted for assessment could be considered academic malpractice and investigated as such.    If the amount of work submitted is higher than that specified by the word limit or that declared on your word count, this may be reflected in the mark awarded and noted through individual feedback given to you.
